The simple filament colour indicator for multi-tool 3D printers, 3D printer add-ons such as the Prusa MMU, Bambu Lab AMS, community add-ons like the ERCF, Box Turtle and others.

Not limited by printer or add-on firmware and only requires a WLED device and RGB LEDs. Although additional functions can be used when connected to a Moonraker enabled printer.

Print Palette can work in two ways, via a post processing script directly in the slicer (Orca preferred) or via a standalone windows app. Print Palette then sends commands to a device running WLED such as an [WeMos D1 Mini ESP8266](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oBwEcnE) with a [strip of RGB LEDs](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ooGWccU) attached to display the filament colour that needs to be loaded into its corresponding tool.
